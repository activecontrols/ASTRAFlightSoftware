# Autogenerating Message Definition Docs

The message definition docs can be autogenerated using the mavlink_gitbook script.
To do so, you must have Python 3 installed. Then:

1. `pip3 install -r ../requirements.txt`
2. `python3 mavlink_gitbook.py`
3. Autogenerated HTML and Markdown docs will be created in the messages/ folder. These can be served with any normal web server; e.g. for local viewing, use `python3 -m http.server docs/` and visit [](http://localhost:8000) in your web browser.
